# pokedex

This is a simple JS app
The live version of the app is here - https://nyaliss19.github.io/pokedex/

The scope of this project was to learn the basics of Javascript, including utilizing an API and pulling data from
it.
The app makes use of modals and buttons.

The API can be found here - https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/

In its current form (as of 4.16.2022), I find it to be functional but not complete.
It's ugly and really only does the bare minimum.
I want to add numbers to the names of the pokemon, as in the world of pokemon, the numbers are as
important if not more so than the names. I know I wouldn't look up a pokemon based on name, it'd be easier
to look up by number.
The app only has the first 150 pokemon, I'd like a button that loads the next batch and so on. It feels incomplete without it. Though, that's a tall order since there are a lot of pokemon and that would make the app's load times
more intense.
